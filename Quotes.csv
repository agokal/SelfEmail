"'PowerPoint presentations are a kind of theater, a kind of augmented stand-up. Too often it's a boring and tedious genre, and audience are subjected to the bad as well as the good. Failing to acknowledge that these are performances is to assume that anyone could and should be able to do it. You wouldnt expect anyone who can simply sing to get up on stage, so why expect everyone with a laptop to be competent in this new theatrical form? Performers try harder.' - David Byrne"

"'I believe my ambition is like a gas, and it will fill the space that I make for it.' - my friend Dave said this in a recent conversation we had together while explaining why his goals were so audacious, and it stuck with me. When I think back to all of the things I'm proud about accomplishing, nearly all of them involved periods when I felt like I was in over my head. I felt like I wasn't ready. Yet, somehow, most of them ended up working out (even if there were some failures along the way).

"'Do you want to be right, or do you want to win?' - a piece of insight given to my (Thomas Frank) friend Dave by one of his friends"
"'What is something you believe that other people think is crazy? That you should never publicly criticize anyone or anything unless it is a matter of morals or ethics. Anything negative you say could at the very least ruin someone’s day, or worse, break someone’s heart, or simply change someone from being a future ally of yours to someone who will never forget that you were unkind or unfairly critical. It’s so common today to complain or criticize others’ work on social media, or dogpile on someone for a perceived offense. I won’t do it. It’s not my job to be the world’s critic, and I’d rather not rule out any future allies.' - From Tools of Titans by Tim Ferriss."
